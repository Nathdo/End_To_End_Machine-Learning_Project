# Marketing Analytics â€“ End-to-End Machine Learning Project

This repository presents a full-cycle marketing analytics project built with Python, focusing on both exploratory data analysis and machine learning to uncover trends and make predictive insights.

## Project Overview
This project is split into two main phases:

ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Data Exploration & Cleaning with Pandas
Using the Pandas library, I dive deep into the marketing dataset to:

* Inspect and clean the data (nulls, duplicates, formatting)
* Analyze sales, marketing expenses, and customer behavior
* Create insightful visualizations to understand key trends and patterns
* Perform aggregations and statistical summaries to guide ML modeling

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Machine Learning & Predictive Modeling
The second part transitions into a machine learning pipeline, where the cleaned data is used to:

* Prepare features (encoding, scaling, transformation)
* Train and evaluate predictive models
* Identify the best-performing algorithm for forecasting marketing trends
* Use model explainability tools (e.g. SHAP) to interpret results

## Objectives
- Understand the drivers behind marketing performance
- Predict future sales or marketing KPIs
- Help guide data-driven decision-making in a marketing context
