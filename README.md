# Marketing Analysis Project

I am currently working on an exciting marketing analytics project using Python, specifically the Pandas library. The first part of my project is to use Pandas to perform in-depth marketing data analysis. This includes reviewing various data such as sales, expenses, trends, etc. With the help of Pandas, I can manipulate and clean data, perform statistical calculations, and create visualizations to better understand trends.

However, the first part of my project is only the beginning, because the second part will be based on the machine learning part. I will use machine learning algorithms to predict future market trends, which is crucial for making informed marketing decisions. For this I will use the data I prepared in the first part of the project using Pandas. I'm really looking forward to seeing what results I can get from applying machine learning techniques to this marketing data.
